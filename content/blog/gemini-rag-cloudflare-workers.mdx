How Google's managed RAG and Cloudflare's edge computing solved problems I didn't know I had

I'm Mert Köseoğlu, Senior Software Engineer turned consultant. 12+ years building teams, leading as Tech Lead and EM, shipping products used by millions. Now I run Software Forge: AI-native architectures, RAG pipelines, Cloudflare AI stack. Built the MCP Directory & Hub handling 100K+ daily requests.

This is the story of building a production RAG system. Not a tutorial. The real thing. Wrong turns, 3am debugging, and decisions that actually mattered.

## The Call That Started Everything

A product analytics company called. "Our Customer Success team is drowning."

500+ Zendesk articles. Blog posts. SDK docs for 11 platforms: Android, iOS, Web, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Windows, Node.js, Java, C++, Cordova. Multiple versions each.

CS team answered the same questions daily. "How do I track events in iOS?" "What's new in Android SDK 24.7?" Hours of repetitive work.

Their AI assistant plugin needed a knowledge base. "Can you build it? 1 month."

I said yes. Then started panicking.

## The First Two Weeks (Where I Got Everything Wrong)

Built a "proper" RAG system. Qdrant. Chunking pipeline. Debated chunk sizes. Metadata filtering.

Two weeks later: slow retrieval, complex infrastructure, not even deployed yet.

Someone asked about "iOS SDK 24.11.3" and the system returned iOS SDK 23.01.2 docs. Three days debugging metadata.

There had to be a better way.

## Finding Gemini File Search

Found it at 2am reading Google's docs. Not heavily marketed. The promise:

> Upload your documents. We handle the rest.

No chunking. No vector database. No embedding selection. Google handles:

- Automatic chunking optimized for retrieval
- Embedding with gemini-embedding-001
- Semantic vector indexing
- Retrieval integrated into generateContent

Skeptical. Tried it anyway. Uploaded test docs. Asked questions. Got accurate answers with source citations.

The code was embarrassingly simple. One API call. fileSearch tool. Done.

Deleted my Qdrant setup. Two weeks of work, gone. Didn't miss it.

## The "Aha" Moment: Grounding Metadata

Gemini returns `groundingChunks`, structured data about which documents were used. Not generated text. Actual metadata from retrieval.

The model can't hallucinate sources. They come from the retrieval layer.

Saved weeks of prompt iteration. No more "please cite your sources" that works 70% of the time.

## Why Cloudflare Workers

I run 100K+ daily requests on Workers. Know the platform.

The reason for this project: **cold starts.**

Lambda: 100-500ms cold starts. Workers: ~0ms. Always warm.

For chat interfaces, users notice. First message feels sluggish on Lambda. On Workers, first request feels like the hundredth.

KV for caching:

- 72-hour cache for GitHub releases (11 SDKs)
- API docs index
- System prompts

No Redis. No connection pooling. Simple.

## The Regex Disaster

Week 3. Certain queries returned wrong results.

"React Native SDK?" → returned iOS docs.

Why? "React Native" contains "rn". I matched "rn" as abbreviation. "Internal" contains "rn" too. Everything matched everything.

500+ lines of regex. Brittle. Non-English broke it. Typos broke it.

Rewrote three times. New edge cases each time.

Then: what if I used an LLM to classify queries?

Gemini 2.0 Flash. JSON response schema. 5-second timeout.

```text
"React Native SDK?" → { isSDKQuery: true, platform: 'react-native' }
```

500 lines of regex → 20 lines of LLM call. Works with typos. Works with any language.

Using one LLM to route another. Changed everything.

## The Caching Discovery

Week 3. SDK version questions: 25 seconds. Every query fetched GitHub releases real-time. Eleven repos. Rate limiting.

Fix: 72-hour cache.

SDK releases don't change hourly. Second query of the day? 7 seconds instead of 25.

Results:

- SDK queries: 25s → 7s (72% faster)
- API queries: 10s → 5-6s (40-50% faster)
- General: 8s → 6s (25% faster)

Simple pattern. Massive impact.

## The Pricing Surprise

Kept waiting for the catch.

**Gemini File Search:**

- Indexing: $0.15 / 1M tokens (one-time)
- Storage: FREE
- Query embeddings: FREE
- 500+ documents: under $1 total indexing.

**Cloudflare Workers:**

- $5/month + $0.50/million requests
- KV: $0.50/million reads

Running production for under $20/month. No vector DB fees. No Redis.

## MCP: One Endpoint, Many Clients

Week 4. They wanted:

- Claude Desktop for engineering
- Cursor for developers
- Internal AI assistant plugin

Four clients. Same knowledge base needed.

Model Context Protocol. One `chat_with_docs` tool. One implementation. Every client connects to same endpoint.

Claude Desktop, Cursor, web UI, internal plugin. All get same answers. Fix a bug, everyone benefits.

Single source of truth.

## After One Month

**Customer Success:**

- Stopped answering same questions repeatedly
- Documentation ticket volume dropped
- Focus on complex issues needing human judgment

**Engineering:**

- Claude Desktop = instant doc access
- Accurate SDK version answers
- Real-time GitHub release data

**AI Assistant:**

- Actually knew things
- Source citations built trust

**Numbers:**

- 500+ documents queryable
- 11 SDK platforms with version-specific answers
- Sub-10-second response times
- Under $20/month

## What I'd Tell My Week-1 Self

1. **Start with managed RAG.** Wasted two weeks on infrastructure Gemini handles better.
2. **Use LLMs for routing.** Intent classification replaced 500 lines of regex.
3. **Cache aggressively.** 72-hour TTL solves 90% of latency problems.
4. **Edge compute matters.** Cold starts add up. Workers eliminates that.
5. **MCP for multi-consumer.** One endpoint, many clients.

The boring choices were the right choices.

Sometimes let Google and Cloudflare handle the hard parts. Focus on making the product work for users.
